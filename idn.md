# Notes on IDN Concepts

## ADDIE

A - Analyze  
D - Design  
D - Develop  
I - Implement  
E - Evaluate  

ADDIE is not agile and requires more time in development.  The process of tweaking designs takes time.  However, having a process is good for collaboration and ensuring that no steps are skipped.


## SAM

S - Successive 
A - Approximations Model 
M - Model   

Iterative steps are employed to reach a goal.  This is a more agile approach.  It allows for products to be released and then tweaked an updated.  The same activities will occur as they do in ADDIE, but they may not be in the same sequences or all used for every iteration.  

## Mayer's 12 Principles of Multimedia  

1.  Coherence Principal 
Humans learn best when extraneous distracting material is not included.  
Often means removing lots of extra text.  

2.  Signaling Principal
Humans learn best when shown exactly what to pay attention to on the screen.  
A simple way to do this is to highlight text or make a graphic use high contrast.

3.  Redunancy Principal
Humans learn with narration and graphics as opposed to narration, graphics, and text.  In video, include graphics and text, but not both together. 
Good idea to include closed captioning for all video though.


4.  Spatial Contiguity Principal
Humans learn best when relevant text and visuals are close together.  
Make it easy for people to relate information to graphics.  

5.  Temporal Contiguity Principal 
Humans learn best when corresponding words and visuals are presented together, rather than in consecutive order.   

6.  Segmenting Principal 
Humans learn best when information is presented in segments rather than in one continuous stream.  

Provide buttons or speed controls so that students have control over the chunks of informations they are taking in.   

7.  Pre-training Principal 
Humans learn better if they already know some of the basics.  

Complex visuals and narrative can overwhelm a viewer if they don't know anything about the topic first.  

8.  Modality Principal 
Humans learn best from visuals and spoken words than visuals and printed words.  

Limit the amount of text on the screen.  Rely on visuals unless you need to provide instruction.  

9.  Multimedia Principal 
Humans learn best from words and pictures rather than just words along.  

Images can enhance information.  Foundational principal.  

10.  Personalization Principal 
Humans learn best from a more informal, conversational voice than an overly formal voice.  

Avoid long, complex words.

11.  Voice Principal 
Humans learn best from a human voice than a computer voice.  

Avoid automated, computer sounding voice.  

12.  Image Principal 

Humans do not necessarily learn better from a talking head video.  

Relevant visuals are more effective than the talking head.
