						<h2>Hi!</h2>
						<p>I worked as a database and application developer at companies around Seattle for many years.
							As an application developer, I created a project scheduler for Boeing Customer Service when
							the personal computer entered the business market. When the power of the Internet made its
							way into our offices and living rooms during the 1990s, I took jobs that would enable me to
							learn to program on the Internet. When a large hospital in the Seattle area got access to a
							feature in the health care system that allowed them to open a web page when a patient chart
							was accessed, I got a job there helping to develop a dashboard that could give a quick
							visual synopsis of the patient's medical status.
						</p>
						<p>Sometimes, I started working for a company to solve a big problem, and sometimes, it was just
							learning about their technology. Since college, I have enjoyed learning. Programming has
							allowed me to test and optimize extensive systems, where I often learn by experimentation.
							When I saw that developer education was expanding a few years ago, I moved away from
							software engineering and into teaching. Developer Education is delivered through
							Universities, Boot Camps, and Corporations, and I've enjoy teaching in all of these venues.
						</p>
						<p>I like creating curriculum. To that end, I started a Master of Science degree at Quinnipiac
							University. The program I completed in 2022 emphasizes multi-media learning. I am most
							motivated to apply it to teaching developers how to work in a constantly evolving field.</p>

											advanced product managers from around the company to discover learning
											objectives and verify the material I shared with the public. As our team
