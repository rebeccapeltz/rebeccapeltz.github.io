						<h2>Hi!</h2>
						<p>I worked as a database and application developer at companies around the Seattle area for
							many years. As an application developer
							I created a projects scheduler for Boeing Customer Service back when the personal computer
							was making its way into
							the business market. When the power of the internet made its way into our offices and
							livingrooms during the 1990's,
							I took jobs that would enable me to to learn to program on the internet. When a large
							hospital in the Seattle area
							got access to a feature in the health care system that allowed them to open a web page when
							a patient chart was accessed,
							I got a job there helping to develop a dashboard that could give a quick visual synopsis of
							the patient's medical status.
						</p>
						<p>Sometimes I started working for a company to solve a big problem, and sometimes it was
							just to learn about the technology they were using.
							Since college, I have enjoyed learning. Programming has made it possible to test and
							optimize big systems, where I am
							often learning by experimentation. A few years ago, as I saw that Developer Education was an
							expanding field, I made a move
							away from Software Engineering and into Teaching. Developer Education can be carried out at
							Universities,
							Bootcamps, and Corporations. I've taught in all of these venues.
						</p>
						<p>I like creating curriculum. To that end, I started a Masters of Science degree at Quinnipiac
							University. The program
							I'm in emphasizes multi-media learning. I have been using what I learned in my job at
							Cloudinary. I think
							there is a lot more I can do in the eLearning space, and I am most motivated to apply it to
							teaching developers how
							to use complex systems.

										<p>I started working for Cloudinary as a Developer Instructional Designer. In
											2022, I was promoted to Curriculum Program Manager for Developer Education.
											I create self service courses
											that are available on the <a href="https://training.cloudinary.com"
												target="_blank">Cloudinary Academy</a> website.
											When I create a course, I work closely with Subject Matter Experts, who are
											developers, solutions architects, support engineers, advanced
											product manager from around the company to discover learning objectives and
											verify the material that I am going to share with the public.
											As our team (the Director and I)
											established a roadmap of courses from beginner to advanced, we started
											repurposing content in different formats. I now spend time
											working on monthly webinars. I recruit subject matter experts from around
											the company to deliver content that
											I create in the form of Goolge slides and code. I also deliver content
											monthly. I'm maintaining the <a
												href="https://www.github.com/cloudinary-training"

											GitHub organization of code repositories that supports all of
											our courses, including the webinars.

											Node.js or Python. I worked closely with students helping them
											troubleshoot their work. Every Friday, I got the students going to the

								<p>I was learning R for a class.  When I started with Rank and Order, I found it a little confusing and 
									wanted to figure out a way to explain it. I also wanted to learn from feedback. </p>

								<h3><a href="#">Transforming Media with Java &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></h3>
								<p>While working at Cloudinary, I created course content with the help of Subject Matter Experts. 
									I would often try to blog about it before we presented the course live.  It helps to create full narratives even if you don't 
								plan on reading them to an audience. </p>

								<h3><a href="#">Webhook-Driven Email Notifications for Media Management</a></h3>
								<p>This slide deck is an example of what I prepare for monthly webinars. As a developer, I am both text oriented and I like to draw boxes with 
									arrows.  As an instructional designer, I am trying to emphasize the visual elements in a slide deck.</p>
