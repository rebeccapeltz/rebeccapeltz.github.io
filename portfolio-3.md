## Description
When you crop an image, you are removing pixels - and a sometimes a big chunk of the image.  If you're doing this manually, you can guide the crop with your mouse. When you do the crop programatically, you can use various techniques with Cloudinary including letting Cloudinary decide what the most interesting part of the crop is.  
This tool is to help you to understand compass based cropping.  The user chooses a compass position and then the X,Y offsets.  The compass position affects of the offset choices vary based on the position chosen.  As you try out different combinations, you will get a visual sense of how the offsets work with the positions.
