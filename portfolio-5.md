## Description
This is a project where I created a video for a course.  I use video a lot at work to make self services courses.  We tape experts walking students through code and explaining concepts. In this video, I'm experimenting with "not talking".  The video is short and visually oriented.  I used some music to "punctuate" portions of the video, but otherwise its a lesson in what the 10 essentials for going on a hike are, and some hints at the problems that can come up if you neglect to bring them.
