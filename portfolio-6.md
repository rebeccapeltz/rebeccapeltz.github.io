## Description
This is a project where I created a video for a course.  In this video, I am trying to succinctly cover the topic of Core Web Vitals.  This was created just before Google implemented Core Web Vitals, which could change the way a website's SEO worked.  Google would rank content based on the performace of the website.  This performance is measurable.  I was aware of the "how and why" to measure because a lot of times it's images and video that slow down the loading of a website.  

## Tools/Technology 
This video was recorded using Snagit, edited with Camtasia, and served on YouTube.
