## Description
I took a course on web design. The main project was to create an education website.  The subject matter of my website is accessiblity which is an important part of [Universal Design for Learning](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).  I tried to follow Accessbility guidelines in building this site. I also share information to help designer appreciate the need for following accessibility guidelines.  There is a video that walks you through the website.

## Tools/Technology 
The website was created using HTML5 and CSS3.  This video was recorded using Snagit, edited with Camtasia, and served on YouTube.
