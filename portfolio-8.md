## Description
Creating slides is an important part of instructional design.  It takes place during the implementation of a training for me.  A big consideration is avoiding the "wall of text".  It's important to keep the experience visual.  I've created slide decks for Cloudinary that will be delivered by other subject matter experts around the company - not just me.  I like to use visuals as both cues to the student and the instructor delivering the content.  "A picture is worth a thousand words".  I try to resuse the ways that I visualize so that it's clear what actions you might take as an instructor when you see something on the slide you're talking about. For example, certain links are placed directly on the slide.  This tells me that it will be helpful to click on and share during the presentation. 

## Tools/Technology 
The slides were created using Google slides.
